Description: This R Package contains functions for manipulation of string values.
    Included are:
    - concatenate_strings(): This function concatenates two character strings with a space in between them. It takes two input strings and combines them into a single string, ensuring there is a space separating the original strings.
    - reverse_string(): This function takes a character string and returns it with the characters in reverse order. It splits the input string into individual characters, reverses their order, and then concatenates them back into a single string.
